# Mario-Kart-7-Manual-APworld
Github repository for BigBradley's Manual APworld for Mario Kart 7.

Wahoo! Mario and his friends have returned to Mario Kart 7 to find out who is truly the best racer amongst them all. To test their skills, they will redo many of their past races and battles under very specific circumstances to win trophies. Can you find all the trophies and become Mario Kart 7 Champion?

Requirements:
- Archipelago 0.6.5 or later
- Manual Client
- Mario Kart 7 with a save file which has all cups, characters, karts, tires, and gliders unlocked (yes, even the gold parts) (if necessary, it is quite easy to find a completed save file online)
- Always use the YAMLs provided in this Github repo, the one made by the APlauncher does not have descriptions for all the settings because I don't know how to do that

Shuffled Items:
- Mode Unlocks (Grand Prix, Time Trials, Balloon Battle, and Coin Runners)
- Cups
- Nitro and Retro battle courses
- FFA and Team battle modes
- Characters
- Karts
- Tires
- Gliders
- Trophys. Collect them all to win!
- Coins (they do nothing)

Checks:
- Winning individual Grand Prix races on every CC
- Getting 1st place overall in Grand Prix cups on every CC
- Defeating Time Trial Staff Ghosts
- Defeating all Time Trial Staff Ghosts in a cup
- Winning individual Battle courses in Balloon Battle and Coin Runners both in a FFA or Team battle
- Getting the most points across three consecutive battles in the Nitro and Retro courses in Balloon Battle and Coin Runners, both in FFA or Team battles
- Winning individual races and battles with specific characters, karts, tires, and/or gliders

Intended Rules:
- You are not allowed to play on/as specific modes, cups, courses, characters, karts, tires, and gliders until they are unlocked
- If you complete a check on a high difficulty, feel free to mark off all the other same checks but on lower difficulties. (ex. if you win 1st place on a track on 150CC you automatically win on that course in 50CC and 100CC)
- You can not start Battle Mode until you have either Balloon Battle or Coin Runners Unlocks, one of the Battle Style Unlocks, and either Nitro or Retro Course Unlocks
- For the Battle Mode Nitro Course and Retro Course checks, play either three Nitro or Retro courses back to back, if you/your team have/has the most points by the third battle, you win
- If you set 'enable_customisables' to 'false' in your yaml, you can use any character, kart, tire, and glider whenever you feel like it. If you feel like it, you can restrict yourself to a specific combination until you get another Coin, which unlocks a random customisable. How you would randomise this is up to you.

Optional Personal Rule:
- If cheats are enabled in your multiworld, use Coins to purchase items using the !getitem <item> command
  Balanced Costs (feel free to use your own costs and rules):
  - Tier 3 - Characters, Karts, Tires, Gliders: 10 Coins
  - Tier 2 - Cups, Battle Courses, Battle Modes, Battle Styles: 50 Coins
  - Tier 1 - Mode Unlocks: 100 Coins
- With each purchase of an item in a tier, the cost of the next purchase in that tier doubles
- Make sure to keep track of your Coins somehow and to communicate with your host about this rule

Goal:
- Collect all Trophys to become Mario Kart 7 Champion. Each mode you enable adds more Trophys, and there are extra options to add more.
- By default, you logically need all Trophys in your world to complete your game, but feel free to ignore logic and set your own personal amount
